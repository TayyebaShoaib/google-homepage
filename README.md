# Creating The Google Homepage

This project was created in accordance with [The Odin Project: HTML/CSS mini project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).

## Details

This project involved making a clone of the [Google](https://www.google.com) homepage.
In order to complete this project, we were allowed to use the developer tools, however, we were encouraged to figure things out on our own.

## My Experience

I enjoyed creating this project. It boosted my confidence to see that I could replecate a professional web page. For this project I tried out my skills in CSS Grid and flexbox.
